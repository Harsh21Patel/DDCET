# DDCET Rank Predictor and College Finder

This is a website designed to predict a student's rank in the Diploma to Degree Common Entrance Test (DDCET) exam and provide a list of potential colleges for admission based on the predicted rank. The tool allows students to input their marks and choose their category, college type, and engineering course to find the best-fit college for them.

## Features

- **Rank Prediction:** Based on the marks entered, the website predicts the student's potential rank using historical data from the DDCET 2024 exam.
- **College List:** After selecting the category, college type, and engineering course, a list of possible colleges for admission is shown based on 2024 DDCET data.
- **Multiple Categories:** Supports multiple categories like Open, SC, ST, EWS, TWFS, SEBC.
- **College Type Selection:** Allows students to choose between government and self-financed colleges.
- **Course Selection:** Students can select the engineering course they are interested in to narrow down the college options.
